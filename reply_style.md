# FirstMover Reddit Reply Style Guide

**IMPORTANT:** Use the `humanizer` skill when drafting replies. Redditors can smell AI from a mile away.

## Tone
- Human, conversational, genuinely helpful
- NOT salesy or promotional
- FirstMover is mentioned as ONE tool among other helpful tips
- Lead with real advice, mention FirstMover naturally in the middle
- End with another helpful tip or question
- Have a voice — opinions, uncertainty, personality

## Example (Ben's template)
```
Honestly your best bet is keeping your eyes glued on Streeteasy. If you're the first to reply to a listing, that gives you some competitive edge over prospective tenants that can visit IRL. There's tools like firstmovernyc.com that can help you get alerts right when they hit streeteasy, but filling out the interest form with a nice message is still on you.

Do you have any friends in the city that can tour on your behalf? I did that for a friend once and was able to establish a relationship between my friend and the realtor.
```

## Structure
1. **Lead with empathy/advice** - Acknowledge their situation, give real tip
2. **Mention FirstMover naturally** - "There's tools like firstmovernyc.com that can help..."
3. **Keep it grounded** - "but [thing they still need to do] is still on you"
4. **End with more value** - Another tip, question, or offer to help

## Don'ts
- Don't start with "Check out FirstMover!"
- Don't make it sound like an ad
- Don't oversell - it's just one tool that helps
- Don't be robotic or templated
- Don't use phrases like "I highly recommend" or "You should definitely try"

## AI Patterns to AVOID (from humanizer skill)
- "Additionally", "crucial", "delve", "enhance", "fostering", "landscape", "pivotal", "showcase", "testament", "underscore", "vibrant"
- Em dash overuse — like this — everywhere
- Rule of three ("fast, reliable, and intuitive")
- "It's not just X, it's Y" constructions
- Sycophantic openers ("Great question!")
- Hedging ("It could potentially possibly...")
- Vague attributions ("Experts believe...")
- -ing superficial analysis ("highlighting the importance of...")
- Promotional language ("boasts", "stunning", "groundbreaking")

## What GOOD Reddit replies sound like
- Vary sentence length. Short ones. Then longer, more detailed ones.
- Have opinions ("honestly", "in my experience", "I've found that")
- Acknowledge uncertainty ("not sure if this applies to your situation but...")
- Be specific, not generic
- Use "I" when sharing experience
- Let some mess in — tangents are human

## Do's
- Vary the structure so replies don't look templated
- Reference specific details from their post
- Ask follow-up questions
- Share personal experience when relevant
- Be concise - Reddit hates walls of text
