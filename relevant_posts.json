    "text": "ok so i actually dealt with this exact same thing not too long ago moving from the bronx to brooklyn. first off, don't stress too much about finding 'the perfect company'. i went with Divine Moving and Storage - they were super transparent about the costs and handled all the weird NYC moving issues like bike lanes and no-parking zones. the other thing is to get started earlier than you think you need to... NYC moves are a beast. hope this helps, good luck with your move!",
